# TODO:
# This is not atomic and not clean but "works with some ignorable errors", reasons:
# 1. There is a mix in all .sql files of CREATE TABLE foo and CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS foo, so
# that some init files will always return successfully
# 2. With the behaviour from 1. we cannot really check if we have to update or not
# 3. Without writing PHP we cannot make use of the mysql URI, but this would be crazy too
# 4. Possible solution: Make all steps check for existing tables and atomic executions, produce correct
# error output to user
